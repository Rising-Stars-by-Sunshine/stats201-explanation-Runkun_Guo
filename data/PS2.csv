Incorporating domain knowledge in machine learning for soccer outcome prediction,"The task of the 2017 Soccer Prediction Challenge was to use machine learning to predict the outcome of future soccer matches based on a data set describing the match outcomes of 216,743 past soccer matches. One of the goals of the Challenge was to gauge where the limits of predictability lie with this type of commonly available data. Another goal was to pose a real-world machine learning challenge with a fixed time line, involving the prediction of real future events. Here, we present two novel ideas for integrating soccer domain knowledge into the modeling process. Based on these ideas, we developed two new feature engineering methods for match outcome prediction, which we denote as recency feature extraction and rating feature learning. Using these methods, we constructed two learning sets from the Challenge data. The top-ranking model of the 2017 Soccer Prediction Challenge was our k-nearest neighbor model trained on the rating feature learning set. In further experiments, we could slightly improve on this performance with an ensemble of extreme gradient boosted trees (XGBoost). Our study suggests that a key factor in soccer match outcome prediction lies in the successful incorporation of domain knowledge into the machine learning modeling process."
Dolores: a model that predicts football match outcomes from all over the world,"The paper describes Dolores, a model designed to predict football match outcomes in one country by observing football matches in multiple other countries. The model is a mixture of two methods: (a) dynamic ratings and (b) Hybrid Bayesian Networks. It was developed as part of the international special issue competition Machine Learning for Soccer. Unlike past academic literature which tends to focus on a single league or tournament, Dolores is trained with a single dataset that incorporates match outcomes, with missing data (as part of the challenge), from 52 football leagues from all over the world. The challenge involved using a single model to predict 206 future match outcomes from 26 different leagues, played from March 31 to April 9 in 2017. Dolores ranked 2nd in the competition with a predictive error 0.94% higher than the top and 116.78% lower than the bottom participants. The paper extends the assessment of the model in terms of profitability against published market odds. Given that the training dataset incorporates a number of challenges as part of the competition, the results suggest that the model generalised well over multiple leagues, divisions, and seasons. Furthermore, while detailed historical performance for each team helps to maximise predictive accuracy, Dolores provides empirical proof that a model can make a good prediction for a match outcome between teams x and y even when the prediction is derived from historical match data that neither x nor y participated in. While this agrees with past studies in football and other sports, this paper extends the empirical evidence to historical training data that does not just include match results from a single competition but contains results spanning different leagues and divisions from 35 different countries. This implies that we can still predict, for example, the outcome of English Premier League matches, based on training data from Japan, New Zealand, Mexico, South Africa, Russia, and other countries in addition to data from the English Premier league.

Modeling outcomes of soccer matches,"We compare various extensions of the Bradley–Terry model and a hierarchical Poisson log- linear model in terms of their performance in predicting the outcome of soccer matches (win, draw, or loss). The parameters of the Bradley–Terry extensions are estimated by maximizing the log-likelihood, or an appropriately penalized version of it, while the posterior densities of the parameters of the hierarchical Poisson log-linear model are approximated using inte- grated nested Laplace approximations. The prediction performance of the various modeling approaches is assessed using a novel, context-specific framework for temporal validation that is found to deliver accurate estimates of the test error. The direct modeling of outcomes via the various Bradley–Terry extensions and the modeling of match scores using the hierarchical Poisson log-linear model demonstrate similar behavior in terms of predictive performance."
RETRACTED ARTICLE: A probabilistic logic approach to outcome prediction in team games using historical data and domain knowledge,"Relational data is structured and, in the real world, ambiguous. Logic can handle relations and probability can handle uncertainty. A probabilistic logic approach to learning can handle both relational structure and uncertainty in the data. Probabilistic logic approach works well with relational data. Incorporating domain knowledge in probabilistic logic approach further enhances learning, improving accuracy. A number of statistical techniques carry out predictive analytics based on historical data alone. Soccer, however, is a team game and the outcome of a soccer game depends on how well the team together and the players play against the opponent team. Thus, data about soccer games are better represented in relational form. In the present work, we propose to learn from soccer match data to predict their outcomes. We learn a model for the prediction of soccer game outcomes, taking into account the history of the matches played by the teams. We frame the background knowledge as rules in the logic program to enhance the prediction. Compared to the traditional machine learning approaches to soccer game outcome prediction, probabilistic logic approach is found to result in significant improvement in prediction accuracy."
When generating a prediction boosts learning: The element of surprise,"Using both behavioral and eye-tracking methodology, we tested whether and how asking students to generate predictions is an efficient technique to improve learning. In particular, we designed two tasks to test whether the surprise induced by outcomes that violate expectations enhances learning. Data from the first task revealed that asking participants to generate predictions, as compared to making post hoc evaluations, facilitated acquisition of geography knowledge. Pupillometry measurements revealed that expectancy-violating outcomes led to a surprise response only when a prediction was made beforehand, and that the strength of this response was positively related to the amount of learning. Data from the second task demonstrated that making predictions about the outcomes of soccer matches specifically improved memory for expectancy-violating events. These results suggest that a specific benefit of making predictions in learning contexts is that it creates the opportunity for the learner to be surprised. Implications for theory and educational practice are discussed."
Forty years of score-based soccer match outcome prediction: an experimental review,"We investigate the state-of-the-art in score-based soccer match outcome modelling to identify the top-performing methods across diverse classes of existing approaches to the problem. Namely, we bring together various statistical methods based on Poisson and Weibull distributions and several general ranking algorithms (Elo, Steph ratings, Gaussian-OD ratings) as well as domain-specific rating systems (Berrar ratings, pi-ratings). We review, reimplement and experimentally compare these diverse competitors altogether on the largest database of soccer results available to identify true leaders. Our results reveal that the individual predictions, as well as the overall performances, are very similar across the top models tested, likely suggesting the limits of this generic approach to score-based match outcome modelling. No study of a similar scale has previously been done."
The Open International Soccer Database for machine learning,"How well can machine learning predict the outcome of a soccer game, given the most com- monly and freely available match data? To help answer this question and to facilitate machine learning research in soccer, we have developed the Open International Soccer Database. Ver- sion v1.0 of the Database contains essential information from 216,743 league soccer matches from 52 leagues in 35 countries. The earliest entries in the Database are from the year 2000, which is when football leagues generally adopted the “three points for a win” rule. To demon- strate the use of the Database for machine learning research, we organized the 2017 Soccer Prediction Challenge. One of the goals of the Challenge was to estimate where the limits of predictability lie, given the type of match data contained in the Database. Another goal of the Challenge was to pose a real-world machine learning problem with a fixed time line and a genuine prediction task: to develop a predictive model from the Database and then to predict the outcome of the 206 future soccer matches taking place from 31 March 2017 to the end of the regular season. The Open International Soccer Database is released as an open science project, providing a valuable resource for soccer analysts and a unique benchmark for advanced machine learning methods. Here, we describe the Database and the 2017 Soccer Prediction Challenge and its results."
